                    <strong>About Ansu</strong><br />
                    Ansu was born on the 27th March and lived in Kottayam, Kerala until she was 23. After her engineering graduation in Computer Science, she currently works  in Bangalore in Kronos Systems Inc.<br /><br /><br />

                    <strong>About Vijay</strong><br />
                    Vijay was born on the 27th October and has lived in Mumbai, Amravati, Chennai, Washington,USA and currently, lives in Bangalore working with Airbus India.<br /><br /><br />

                    <strong>How we met</strong><br />
                    Nowadays when somebody sees our committed status in Facebook, thus declaring ourselves socially engaged
                    (for those who take facebook as a religion!!) and asks,"Awww.. Love Marriage?".I reply in the negative.
                    The next question would be "Love-arranged?" I then would say "Arranged-cum-Love", proud to come up with a
                    new term in relationship philosophy.<br/><br/>

                    I "proposed" Ansu over our "second" date set up by my family.<br/><br/>
                    During our first meeting which lasted for about 20 minutes, she had maintained the 'mystery' and 'innocence'
                    with her short and sweet answers, after which I am sure neither me or she, could tell anything about each other.
                    During that time I really felt, was she really the one I had been waiting for? Believe me it so difficult to give an
                    instantaneous answer to this question to a person whom you are intending to share the rest of your life with.
                    Having said in broken malayalam about all sorts of my likes and way of life that I need to share with her packed in that
                    compressed 20 odd minutes, at least I felt assured when she said  "I'm ok,if you are ok" accepting the deal romantically.<br/><br/>


                    Sometimes, you need to unkowingly fall in Love to realise what Love is.
                    Perhaps, our cherised thoughts of each others better half might be the most ideal parts played in our fairytale stories.
                    The only difficulty is neither of us know how the story starts. We think of the most dramatic and romantic begining that could
                    have ignited the story, like meeting one another during travel, unknowing meeting in facebook, meeting as a friend's friend etc etc.
                    I think its an equally dramatic and romantic begining when one feels "comfortable" with other which happened the very first time we met. :-).<br/><br/>

                    And unknowingly I fell for her.<br/><br/>

                    And now we just started telling our own fairytale stories....and there is so much to be explored....<br/><br/>
